## User Experience (UX)
### **Purpose**

Muma & Cub has been created as a fictional website for the purposes of completing the first milestone project as part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. It developed as an idea from personal experience of needing a social support for parents in the local community. The needs of new parents are central to considerations around User Experience (UX) and User Interface Design (UI) and this is reflected throughout the site.

The site has been built with a mobile-first responsive design. Keeping the needs of the user at the fore-front of the design process particularly in the strategy and scope development stages.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
This website uses a palette of earthy colours with shades pulled from greens, pinks and browns. These embody the feel that I wanted to create for the site; natural and calming.
